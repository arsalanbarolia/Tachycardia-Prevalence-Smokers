## Abstract

<p align="justify">

Pacemakers, for many, is an essential implantable machine that helps keep one alive. It ensures that an individual’s heart is beating consistently through small segmented electrical pulses while simultaneously helping in any abnormal heart rhythms that may occur<sup>1</sup>. Single chamber, dual chamber, and biventricular pacemakers are the 3 types of pacemakers used in modern day to correct irregular heart rhythms. Tachycardia is a common type of irregular heart rhythm that is referred to an irregular/abnormal fast paced heart rhythm, that range over 100 beats per minute (bpm) where a normal heartbeat ranges from 60-80 bpm. The types of tachycardia, such as atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation are classified by the part of the heart it originates from. Tachycardias can cause dizziness, light headedness, and shortness of breath and if untreated, can lead to heart failure, stroke, and/or sudden cardiac arrest or death<sup>1</sup>. With tachycardia being one of the most common heart arrhythmias present in all types of individuals, and the number of smokers and pacemaker patients steadily increasing due to population growth and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)<sup>2,3</sup>, respectively, it is important to ensure that pacemakers are being kept up-to-date with modern lifestyles and health pandemics. The proposed research project will investigate if a smoker’s pacemaker will display more signs of tachycardia than a pacemaker of a non-smoker through two analysis: (i) determining if the pacemaker’s functionality for correcting atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation is affected because of smoking and (ii) determining if smoking increases one’s heart rate that has a dual-chamber pacemaker.
